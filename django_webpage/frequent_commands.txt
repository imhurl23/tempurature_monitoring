Commands that were frequently used/helpful to have saved while working on the lightsail server

Instructions on how to run django app on our lighsail server
    SSH into lightsail
    Generic command: ssh -i /location/of/keys/key.pem bitnami@[CURRENT IP]

    Switch to this directory on lightsail server:
    /home/bitnami/stack/projects/Yogurt

    In settings.py make sure that ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
    This is not ideal for security but makes running this simple site much easier

    Run django server on 0.0.0.0 at a designated port (I used 8000 for testing):
    python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:[PORT]

    After that command, you can access the website on any device at
    [CURRENT IP]:[PORT]/temperature


Transfering files to the server
    Generic: scp -i /path/key.pem /path/file.txt bitnami@[SERVER IP]:/path/destination


Retrieve files from server:
    scp -i path/to/key.pem bitnami@[SERVER IP]:~/path/to/retrieve/file.zip /home/directory


Backing up versions:
    Zip the folder:
        zip -r out.zip folder
        zip -r yogurt_nov_30.zip Yogurt
    retrieve from server and save on local machine
        scp bitnami@[SERVER IP]:~/path/to/file.zip /home/directory
